## Kabstand

A simple, correct, efficient [interval tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree) implementation.

Note: This is a Kotlin port of the [abstand](https://www.github.com/io7m-com/abstand) package
      for users who are stuck on Android and cannot use modern Java. You
      probably want that package instead of this one.
